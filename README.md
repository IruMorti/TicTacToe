# TicTacToe Online



This project was one of my first attempts at building an online multiplayer game.  

The main TicTacToe gameplay works, and players can compete against each other in real time.



\## Chat Feature

The in-game chat is \*\*not finished and will probably not be completed\*\*.  

It is included in its current state, but some features may be missing or unstable.



## Usage

You are free to \*\*use, modify, or reuse\*\* this project in any way you like.
